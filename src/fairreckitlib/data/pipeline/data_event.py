    ON_BEGIN_MODIFY_DATASET: id of the event that is used when dataset ratings are being modified.
    ON_BEGIN_SAVE_SETS: id of the event that is used when the train and test sets are being saved.
    ON_BEGIN_SPLIT_DATASET: id of the event that is used when a dataset is being split.
    ON_END_DATA_PIPELINE: id of the event that is used when the data pipeline ends.
    ON_END_FILTER_DATASET: id of the event that is used when dataset filtering finishes.
    ON_END_LOAD_DATASET: id of the event that is used when a dataset has been loaded.
    ON_END_MODIFY_DATASET: id of the event that is used when dataset ratings have been modified.
    ON_END_SAVE_SETS: id of the event that is used when the train and test sets have been saved.
    ON_END_SPLIT_DATASET: id of the event that is used when a dataset has been split.

Functions:

    get_data_events: get data pipeline events.
