"""This module contains counting functionality.

Both APC and ALC can be used in the Kullback-Leibler formula,
for which the module is also in this package.
As of now, they don't specifically count the 'artist'
play and listen count, but just whatever is in the 'item' column.
If you pass a dataframe for which the 'item' column contains artists,
it should work correctly, otherwise it will require changes to work properly.

Functions:

    get_item_dict: return dict with unique items.
    calculate_apc: count the artist play count.
    calculate_alc: count the artist listener count.

This program has been developed by students from the bachelor Computer Science at
Utrecht University within the Software Project course.
