"""This module contains all event ids, event args and a print switch that are IO related.

Constants:

    ON_MAKE_DIR: id of the event that is used when a directory is created.
    ON_REMOVE_DIR: id of the event that is used when a directory is removed.
    ON_CREATE_FILE: id of the event that is used when a file is created.
    ON_REMOVE_FILE: id of the event that is used when a file is removed.
    ON_RENAME_FILE: id of the event that is used when a file is renamed.

Classes:

    DirEventArgs: event args related to a directory.
    FileEventArgs: event args related to a file.
    DataframeEventArgs: event args related to a dataframe.
    RenameFileEventArgs: event args related to renaming a file.

Functions:

    get_io_events: list of IO event IDs.
    get_io_event_print_switch: switch to print IO event arguments by ID.
    print_load_dataframe_event_args: print dataframe event arguments for loading.

This program has been developed by students from the bachelor Computer Science at
Utrecht University within the Software Project course.
