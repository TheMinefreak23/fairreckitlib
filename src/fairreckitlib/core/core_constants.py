    SURPRISE_API: name of the Surprise API.

    KEY_NAME: the key that is used for a name.
    KEY_PARAMS: the key that is used for params.
    KEY_TYPE: the key that is used for types.

    TYPE_PREDICTION: the prediction experiment type.
    TYPE_RECOMMENDATION: the recommender experiment type.

    VALID_TYPES: the valid experiment types.

    KEY_TOP_K: the key that is used for top k.
    KEY_RATED_ITEMS_FILTER: the key that is used for the rated items filter.

    DEFAULT_TOP_K: the default top k for recommender experiments.
    DEFAULT_RATED_ITEMS_FILTER: the default rated items filter for recommender experiments.

    MODEL_USER_BATCH_SIZE: the batch size of users that is used when model computations are done.
