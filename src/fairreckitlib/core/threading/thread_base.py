    Wraps the threading module in a class interface. The main function of each

    1) Initialize

    Threads are not running on creation, only after the start() function is called.

    once the stop() function is called it requests the thread to finish.
    Threads cannot be cancelled so any derived class logic needs to account for this request
    by checking the is_running function pointer (in step 2) regularly.
