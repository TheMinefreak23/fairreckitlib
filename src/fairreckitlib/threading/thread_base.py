    Wraps the threading module in a class interface. The main function of each
    thread consists of three steps:

    1) Initialize
    2) Run
    3) Terminate

    Threads are not running on creation, only after the start() function is called.
    The function is_running() will return True as long as the thread is active,
    once the stop() function is called it requests the thread to finish.
    Threads cannot be cancelled so any derived class logic needs to account for this request
    by checking the is_running function pointer (in step 2) regularly.

        name(str) the name of the thread.
